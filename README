2-3 Hour Homework

Try to use source data file to generate the "LOAN PERFORMANCE DETAILS" similar to the one on https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action"

1.Choice of direction and why
  java (jdk-12.0.1) for implementation;
  opencsv5,commons-lang3 as lib for csv file read/write
  
  First, I use excel to validate the source data; make sure I could figure out how each report column generated based on source files;
  Second, I defined several java data model class to populate what we need from the source file
  Last, I implement the report generate process
  
2. Where you ran into issues

The most challenging part is understand the problem and figure out how each report data get generatd;
The LendingClub has description for each field but it might be vague for developer to fing the right place and combine;

I ran into timeout of 2hour, so I gave up the generation of last fields "ADJ. NET ANNUALIZED RETURN"

3. Any other context you think we should have

Basically I generated a runnable jar file named "LoanReport.jar"

I accept two argument [sourceFile] [destFile]
sourceFile --- the raw data file we download from LendingClub, defaut to be "LoanStats_securev1_2018Q4.csv"
destFile --- the performance report file, default to be "perf_securev1_2018Q4.csv"

For example:

java -jar LoanReport.jar   //using default argument
java -jar LoanReport.jar  LoanStats_securev1_2018Q4.csv   // specify data source file 
java -jar LoanReport.jar  LoanStats_securev1_2018Q4.csv   target.csv  //specify both source/target files
